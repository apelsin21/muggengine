<<<<<<< HEAD
Shitty Lua and C++ "game engine", depends on SDL 2, FreeImage, FreeType, ENet, Lua, and GLEW.

=======
Game engine using OpenGL v3.0 for rendering, Lua for scripting, OpenAL for audio,
Bullet for physics, ENet for networking, and SDL 2 for window and misc.

Will expand when closer to version 0.00000000000001.
