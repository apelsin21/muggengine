==========

Shitty Lua and C++ "game engine", needs to link with SFML 2.1(the entire stack, sfml-graphics is used to load textures and the likes), lua 5.2, glew, assimp 3.x in order to compile.

Builds and runs on whatever SFML supports, which is probably only x86 Windows, Mac, Linux and ARM Linux(Although OpenGL ES isn't supported, so no graphics on Raspberry Pi).
