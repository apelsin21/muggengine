muggengine
==========

Game engine written in C++ using modern OpenGL for rendering, Lua for scripting, OpenAL for audio,
Bullet for physics, ENet for networking, Assimp for importing/exporting common model formats, and SDL 2 for window and misc.

Supports Linux, Windows. Not Mac/OSX since I've never really used one and don't know the differences.

Will crash and bug out on anything other than Linux, and probably on Linux too. Don't use this.
